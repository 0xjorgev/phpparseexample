Installation
------------

Testing the Parse PHP SDK involves some set-up.  You'll need to create a Parse
App just for testing, and deploy some cloud code to it.

* [Get Composer], the PHP package manager.
* Run "composer install" to download dependencies.
* Create a new app here: [Create Parse App]
* Use the Parse CLI to create a Cloud Code folder for the new app.
* Copy tests/cloudcode/cloud/main.js into the newly created cloud/ folder.
* Run "parse deploy" in your cloud folder.
* Paste your App ID, REST API Key, and Master Key in tests/ParseTestHelper.php

You should now be able to execute, from the tests/ folder:

    ../vendor/bin/phpunit --stderr .

At present the full suite of tests takes around 20 minutes.
